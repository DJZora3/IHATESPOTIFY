Requirements:
windows 11, should work with 10 (untested)
python (coded and tested for version 3.13.0) (make sure python is in path, otherwise the .bat will NOT work)
python-vlc (installed via the command 'py -m pip install python-vlc' on the console)

installation process:
go into the .bat file, change the cd to the file path to the folder musicplayermain.py is in.
Volume will be preset to 50 (100 is really really loud)

Description:
Runs a python file that will play music, after you have entered file paths to files containing ONLY valid audio files that will work with VLC. Tested with mp3 and m4a, everything else is 100% unknown but will probably work.

Just a test project to get my feet wet for the most part, but I had fun coding it and will probably keep using it over spotify when I am on my computer. Might add more features/updates or whatever, but don't count on it. Thanks!

Feel free to use or distribute or whatever. I don't care. Licenses be damned!
